# Game-Challenge
The Game Challenge website is an interactive front-end web application designed to test players' memory and reflexes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game features a colorful interface with multiple buttons, each assigned a unique sound. When the game starts, a sequence of buttons lights up one by one, and players must replicate the pattern by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Each button press produces a distinct sound, adding an auditory cue to the visual sequence. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging, requiring players to stay focused and attentive. If the player correctly enters the sequence, they advance to the next round with a new, more complex pattern. However, if they press the buttons in the wrong order, they lose the game, and an alert signals the end of the challenge. 

The website's responsiveness ensures a seamless experience across devices, while its engaging design and interactive features make it appealing to users of all ages. The game's mechanics are powered by JavaScript functions that manage button animations, sound effects, and sequence validation. Players can refresh the game or reset their progress to try again. This project showcases the creative use of front-end development skills to build an entertaining and educational web-based memory game.
